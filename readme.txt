== Description ==
Display your latest tweets in just a few clicks on your site.

A simple widget/shortcode which lets you add your latest tweets in your content or widget areas. Get started in just a few clicks and use the provided Widget/Shortcode to easily display your Tweets on your website.

There is no need to create a Twitter application and provides a nice interface to display your tweets in an easy way, just install the plugin and set the options.

It uses the official Twitter's Embedded Timelines Widget functionality. Twitter offers embeddable timelines that allow you to display any public Twitter feed on your blog. These timelines are interactive, so readers can reply, retweet and favorite tweets straight from your blog or website.

= Features =
* Very easy to setup and use.
* Don't need to create an API.
* Automatically detect your site language to load and display Twitter's text components.
* Display the latest Tweets from a Twitter account, lists, likes, or your curated collections.
* Scripts only loaded when it's necessary (only on those pages that contain the widget) improving the speed of your site.
* You can blend your tweets professionally by customizing the link color, border color, background choice and other useful options.
* Support for multiple Twitter accounts.
* Multisite support.

= Why do I develop and mantain this plugin? =
I tried a lot of plugins (Jetpack included) and all of them load unnecessary JS and CSS scripts all over the site, even when the plugin/widget is not displayed. Every file/script loaded in your site generate extra requests for your server and affect your site load time, ending up affecting the final user experience.

That's why I decided to develop this simple and easy plugin.
